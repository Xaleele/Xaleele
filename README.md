## 👋 Hey, I'm Xaleele

I'm a Technical Program Manager who likes to build useful, slightly-overengineered things with Python, Postgresql, and a bit of AI magic.

### ⚡️ What I Do
- Build web apps using **Python**, **Django**, and **Flask**
- Deploy with **Render**
- Tame APIs like OpenAI’s and turn machine learning ideas into actual tools
- Visualize data with **Tableau** and SQL and other visualization tools
- Wrangle cloud stuff on **GCP** without setting off billing alarms

### 🧠 Currently Learning
- Finetuning models with **OpenAI**
- More about **MLOps** and not just pretending I understand vector databases

### 🔥 Featured Project
**[FDA Radar](https://fda-radar.onrender.com)** — a real-time web app that helps users monitor FDA recall data.  
- Hosted on Render  
- Uses OpenAI API for smart categorization  
- Yes, it works. Adding more features in the near future.

### 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On
- AI/ML tools that accelerate consumer HealthTech and MedTech 
- Projects that blend data + design + functionality
