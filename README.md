## 👋 Hey, I'm Xaleele

I'm a Technical Program Manager who likes to build useful, slightly-overengineered things with Python, Postgresql, and a bit of AI magic.

### ⚡️ What I Do
- Build web apps using **Python**, **Next.js**, and **Supabase** 
- Deploy with **Render**
- Wrangle cloud stuff on **GCP** without setting off billing alarms

### 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On
- AI/ML tools that accelerate consumer HealthTech and MedTech 
- Projects that blend data + design + functionality  

### 📫 Let’s Chat
Right here on GitHub — open an issue, drop a star, or pretend this is LinkedIn and vibe silently.
