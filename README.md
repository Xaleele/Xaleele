# Hey, I'm Xaleele

I build software for regulated industries — where compliance isn't optional and shortcuts aren't an option.

I'm currently developing **[Tesseran](https://tesseran.io)**, a multi-tenant Quality Management System designed for pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotech companies. It handles document control, electronic signatures, CAPA tracking, and audit trails aligned with 21 CFR Part 11 — built from the ground up.

### Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security, Supabase Auth & Storage |
| **Infra** | Render, GitHub Actions |
| **External** | openFDA API (devices, drugs, recalls, adverse events) |

### What Tesseran Does

- **Document control** with versioning, multi-step approval workflows, and soft delete with 30-day recovery
- **Electronic signatures** backed by SHA-256 integrity hashing, identity verification, and non-repudiation
- **CAPA and change control** with full lifecycle tracking and activity logs
- **FDA regulatory intelligence** pulling 510(k) clearances, MAUDE reports, drug approvals, and enforcement actions from openFDA
- **Immutable audit trail** — append-only, hash-verified, exportable to CSV, PDF, and JSON
- **Multi-tenant isolation** enforced at the database level with row-level security
